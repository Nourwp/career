Real-time App with MERN Stack (React.js, Node.js, MongoDB, Socket.io)
Description:

This project is a full-fledged, real-time IAPP built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) and Socket.io for seamless communication. It delves into every step of the development process, from setting up the backend API and database models to building a responsive React frontend with rich features like user authentication, post creation, live updates, chat functionality, and more. This project is an excellent resource for developers at all levels seeking to enhance their web development skills and create a powerful addition to their portfolio.

Technologies Used:

Backend: Node.js (v18.x recommended), Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, Socket.io

Frontend: React.js (v18.x recommended), Vite, Tailwind CSS (or your preferred CSS framework)

State Management: Redux Toolkit (or your preferred state management solution)

Additional Dependencies:

axios (HTTP requests)
class-variance-authority (type safety)
clsx (utility functions for CSS classes)
lucide-react (icons)
next-themes (theme management)
react-icons (additional icons)
react-router-dom (routing)
redux-persist (persisting state)
sonner (state management utilities)
tailwind-merge (CSS merging)
tailwindcss-animate (CSS animations)


Project Structure:

backend/: Contains the Node.js server code, API endpoints, database models, and Socket.io configuration.
frontend/: Houses the React application code for building the user interface, managing state, and handling user interactions.
Installation:

Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/Nourwp/career.git
Navigate to the project directory: cd <career>
Install dependencies: npm install (or yarn install) Â  
Setup (Optional):

Create a .env file in the project root directory with the following environment variables (replace placeholders with your actual values):

PORT=8000
MONGO_URL=mongodb+srv://<your-username>:<your-password>@<your-cluster-name>.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key (replace with a strong random string)
// ... other environment variables as needed (e.g., Cloudinary API keys)
(Optional) Set up a cloudinary account for image storage and obtain your API key, API secret, and cloud name.

Running the Application:

Start the backend server: npm run dev (or yarn dev) - This will run the backend server in development mode with Nodemon for automatic restarts on code changes.
In a separate terminal, start the frontend development server: cd frontend && npm run dev (or yarn dev) - This will start the React development server, typically on http://localhost:3000 (port may vary).
Development:

Use npm run lint (or yarn lint) to run code linting and fix any potential issues.
Leverage the hot reloading features of Vite and React for a seamless development experience.
